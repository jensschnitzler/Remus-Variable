# Remus Variable

Remus Variable is a derivat of the sans-serif typeface TeX Gyre Heros published by GUST e-foundry. The goal is to combine the different static styles of TeX Gyre Heros into one variable font with axes for width, weight and slant.


## Renaming from Gyre Heros to Remus

I renamed this project to Remus. With this name I would like to reference both TeX Gyre Heros and its predecessor [Nimbus Sans L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbus_Sans#Nimbus_Sans_L). Also I want to ensure differentiability between this project and TeX Gyre Heros.

_GUST about TeX Gyre Heros:_
TeX Gyre Heros is based on the URW Nimbus Sans L kindly released by URW++ Design and Development Inc. under GFL (independently of the GPL release accompanying Ghostscript). The Vietnamese glyphs were added by Han The Thanh. TeX Gyre Heros can be used as a replacement for a popular font Helvetica, also known as Swiss (prepared by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann, 1957, at the Haas Type Foundry).
